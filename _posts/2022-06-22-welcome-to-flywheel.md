The era of digitization and intelligence is coming. 

In order to form a strong core competency, I am always undertaking cognitive transformation and forming your own infrastructure.


Transformation and Infrastructure
------------

`Tyo` (Transformation your own) and `Iyo` (Infrastructure your own) are two really effective methods that I've proposed to help me making changes spontaneously.

### Transformation your own ###

A full understanding of digitization and intelligence is a milestone on your transformation journey. Correct interpretation of them is also an important task of this column.

### Infrastructure your own ###

Your infrastructure should include: product, technology, business and strategy. This column will lead you on the right path and help you build your own infrastructure.


Flywheel and Four Focus
------------

I focus on new product development and product management. Usually I am used to analyzing from four dimensions one by one, and comprehensively look at the product I am creating. I call this approach the flywheel model or **Flywheel**.

  * Product
  * Technology
  * Business
  * Strategy
